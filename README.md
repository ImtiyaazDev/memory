## About the Commit Structure

Please note that this projects commit structure will follow semantic conventions to the best of my capability. This ensures that each commit is well-defined and clear on what the commit entails.

The commit prefix along with their meaning is as follows: 

- `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

These short descriptions should be prefixed to each commit under the respective change.

For more information on this convention, [please read the documentation](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716).
